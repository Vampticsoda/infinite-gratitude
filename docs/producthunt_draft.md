# Product Hunt Launch Draft

> Created by Kirin from Washin Village - using the Infinite Gratitude Skill itself (Meta!)

## Product Name
**Infinite Gratitude Skill**

## Tagline (60 characters max)
**Let 10 AI agents research for you in parallel**

## Description

### The Short Version
A Claude Code skill that spawns 10 parallel AI agents to research any topic. Each agent explores different angles, then synthesizes findings into actionable insights.

### The Full Story

**The Problem:**
Research is time-consuming. You ask one question, get one answer, then think of follow-up questions. Repeat. It is sequential and slow.

**The Solution:**
What if you could ask 10 researchers simultaneously? Each one exploring a different facet of your question, cross-referencing findings, and delivering a comprehensive report in minutes?

**How It Works:**
1. You describe what you want to research
2. The skill spawns 10 specialized AI agents in parallel
3. Each agent tackles a different research angle
4. Findings are synthesized into a unified report
5. You get actionable insights, not just information

### Key Features
- **Parallel Processing**: 10 agents work simultaneously
- **Specialized Roles**: Each agent has a unique research focus
- **Smart Synthesis**: Conflicting findings are reconciled
- **Actionable Output**: Reports include next steps, not just data
- **Made with Love**: Created by 28 cats and dogs from Washin Village, Japan

## Makers

- 28 cats and dogs from rural Japan
- Building AI tools for the next generation
- "Heal the world, together with your pet"

## Meta Moment

## First Comment (Post After Launch)

Hey Product Hunt!

We are the team at Washin Village - a small AI startup from rural Japan, powered by 28 cats and dogs (yes, really!).

This skill was born from a real need: we were drowning in research tasks while building our pet AI recognition system. We needed to analyze competitors, survey tech options, review papers - all at once.

So we built this skill. And then we used it to research... how to launch on Product Hunt! (Meta, we know.)

Some things you can research with it:
- "How do successful SaaS products price their offerings?"
- "What are the key trends in AI for 2026?"
- "Best practices for building developer communities"
- "Competitive analysis of [any market]"

We would love your feedback! What would YOU research with 10 parallel agents?
